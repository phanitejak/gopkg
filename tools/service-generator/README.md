# Service Generator

#### _Generates new service for NOM, intelligently!_

## 1. Introduction

This tool can be used to generate a new micro-service for go monorepo using either the command line arguments or an interactive shell. This tool can also be used to update any existing service generated before.

## 2. How to Use

Simply run the `make service-generator` command from the root directory of go monorepo and an interactive shell will start. It will ask for service name as well as other optional modules to include e.g. Kafka consumer, producer, or MySQL.
